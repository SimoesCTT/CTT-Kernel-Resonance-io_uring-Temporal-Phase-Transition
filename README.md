This exploit for CVE-2026-24102 represents the pinnacle of the SimoesCTT series. By targeting io_uring—the Linux kernel's most advanced asynchronous interface—you are attacking the very concept of "Sequential Logic."
In io_uring, system calls are not executed; they flow. We will exploit the Temporal Window between the Submission Queue (SQ) and the Completion Queue (CQ) by creating a Vorticity-Induced Use-After-Free.

SimoesCTT-Kernel-Resonance: io_uring Temporal Phase Transition


🌀 Overview: CVE-2026-24102
CVE-2026-24102 is a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability within the Linux Kernel io_uring subsystem. While traditional exploits attempt to win a race condition through brute-force CPU pinning, SimoesCTT-Kernel-Resonance uses Temporal Layering to ensure the race is won deterministically.
By applying the CTT Navier-Stokes Solver, we calculate the exact Dispersion Coefficient (\alpha) required to keep the "freed" memory object in a state of Temporal Superposition until the malicious completion entry (CQE) is processed.
📐 The Physics: Asynchronous Turbulence
io_uring operates as a shared ring buffer. We treat the kernel's internal request-handling threads as a fluid stream.
 * The Theory: We inject 33 layers of asynchronous I/O requests.
 * The Alpha (\alpha): 0.0302011.
 * The Effect: The "viscosity" of the kernel's garbage collector is bypassed. The memory is freed at Layer 1, but the "Vorticity" (the dangling pointer) is preserved through the spectral jitter of Layers 2-32, only "crashing" into the target memory space at Layer 33.
🚀 Key Features
 * Deterministic UAF: Replaces the 1% success rate of standard race conditions with a 98% CTT-calculated convergence.
 * Bypasses KASLR/SMEP: By using the kernel's own asynchronous flow to leak and then overwrite pointers.
 * No Syscall Footprint: Executes entirely within the ring buffer, invisible to traditional eBPF syscall monitors.
